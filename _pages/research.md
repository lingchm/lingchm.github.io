My research fall under three main categories:

1. **Machine Learning with limited supervision and knowledge integration**
2. **Machine Learning with multi-source/multi-modal data**
3. **Data mining and subgroup identification**

Application domains of my research include: 

##### **Precision Medicine of Brain Cancer**. 

This research aims to develop personalized machine learning models to predict regional tumor cell density from MRI. My contributions included developing a novel weakly-supervised transfer learning (WS-TL) model that leverages domain knowledge about the tumor, which addresses the small sample problem while quantifying intratumoral heterogeneity; and building a GUI for non-technical users to run pre-operative and post-operative model to assist cancer treatment.

##### **Biomarker Discovery for Persistent Post-traumatic Headache**

This research develops predictive machine learning algorithms for the prognosis of post-traumatic headache based on neuroimaging (MRI, fMRI, DTI), clinical questionnaires, and mobile-collected speech data. My contributions include: 1) developing prognostic models of headache persistence, 2) identifying patient subgroups with distinct headache evolution trajectories, and 3) developing a clinical tool for prognosis of headache persistence adaptable for patients with different data modalities.

##### **Early prediction of Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease**. 
This research aims to do early prediction of AD conversion from multi-modal neuroimaging and genetics data (MRI, PET, SNP). My contribution include: 1) developing a novel Supervised Multi-modal Fission Learning (MMFL) model for predictive modeling under incomplete-modality data, and 2) developing a new mutual student-teacher multi-modal learning model with theoretical analysis of the knowledge distillation effectiveness.

##### **Analyzing Influence of Public Health Organizations on Social Media**
This project aims to assess health organization's influence on social media to derive dissemination strategy recommendations. We designed a four-dimensional framework to analyze topic-specific influence on Twitter. We applied this framework to 1M+ tweets from health organizations and analyzed their influence about dietary sodium intake, one of the risk factors of cardiovascular diseases. I mentored a masters, an undergraduate, and three high school students in this project.

##### **Prediction of Unplanned Hospitalization of Medicare Patients**
This project developed machine learning models to predict unplanned hospitalization of eight types of common diseases and four type of adverse events by analyzing over 15M Medicare claims and various public datasets. My methodological contributions included co-developing a multi-layered feature selection and dynamic personalized scoring algorithm to predict monthly hospitalization risk for individual patients. 

*This project was led by Drs. Julie Swann and Dr. Sara Shashaani from North Carolina State University. The NCSU team was selected top 25 out of 300+ teams into Stage I of the 2020 national \$1M CMS AI Health Outcomes Challenge.*
