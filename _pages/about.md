I’m a Ph.D. in Machine Learning student at Georgia Tech working at the intersection of applied and theoretical machine learning, with a focus on machine learning with limited supervision and multi-modal/high-dimensional datasets. My goal is to develop knowledge-informed, robust, and efficient next-generation models for personal health. 

I work with [Dr. Jing Li](https://sites.gatech.edu/jing-li/) at the H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering. Our research outcomes have been applied to support clinical decision making for diagnosis, prognosis, and knowledge discovery of various neurological diseases, such as brain tumor, post-traumatic headache, and Alzheimer’s disease. 

Prior to joining Georgia Tech, I have worked with [Dr. Sara Shashaani](https://shashaani.wordpress.ncsu.edu/) and [Dr. Julie Swann](https://www.ise.ncsu.edu/people/jlswann/) from North Caroline State University on analyzing million-scale medical claims datasets to predict trends for unplanned hospitalizations; and with [Dr. Yanfang Su](https://globalhealth.washington.edu/faculty/yanfang-su) from University of Washington to analyze public health policies in the area of dietary sodium reduction and its trends on social media. See [publications](/al-folio/publications/) for more details.
