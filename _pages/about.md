Hi, thanks for stopping by! 👋

I'm a Machine Learning PhD at Georgia Tech's [H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/), advised by Prof. [Jing Li](https://sites.gatech.edu/jing-li/). My research focuses on the development of novel machine learning methodologies to analyze complex, multi-modal, high-dimensional biomedical datasets. My research outcomes has been applied to support diagnosis, prognosis, and knowledge discovery of brain cancer, post-traumatic headache, and Alzheimer’s Disease. 
<!-- 
Before that, I worked with [Dr. Sara Shashaani](https://shashaani.wordpress.ncsu.edu/) and [Dr. Julie Swann](https://www.ise.ncsu.edu/people/jlswann/) analyzing medical claims and with [Dr. Yanfang Su](https://globalhealth.washington.edu/faculty/yanfang-su) analyzing health-related social media data.  -->

Outside research, I like building fun ML/AI tools such as [MMTrip](https://youtu.be/g0p3DScMEJs) and [AskMendel](https://askmendel.ai/). 

Here is my [CV](/assets/pdf/cv_lingchaomao.pdf) and one-page [resume](/assets/pdf/resume_lingchaomao.pdf).
