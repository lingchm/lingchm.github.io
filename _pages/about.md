Hey, thanks for stopping by! üëã

I am a Machine Learning PhD at Georgia Tech working at the intersection of applied and theoretical machine learning. 

Advised by [Dr. Jing Li](https://sites.gatech.edu/jing-li/), I study how to use machine learning to support diagnosis, prognosis, and knowledge discovery of neurological diseases such as brain cancer, post-traumatic headache, and Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease. Before that, I worked with [Dr. Sara Shashaani](https://shashaani.wordpress.ncsu.edu/) and [Dr. Julie Swann](https://www.ise.ncsu.edu/people/jlswann/) from NC State University analyzing millions of medical claims and with [Dr. Yanfang Su](https://globalhealth.washington.edu/faculty/yanfang-su) from UW analyzing health-related public engagements on social media. 

Outside research, I like building accessible and fun ML/AI tools such as [MMTrip](https://youtu.be/g0p3DScMEJs) and [AskMendel](https://askmendel.ai/). See [tools](/tools/).

Here is my [CV](/assets/pdf/cv_lingchaomao.pdf) and one-page [resume](/assets/pdf/resume_lingchaomao.pdf).
