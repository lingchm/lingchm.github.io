Hey, thanks for stopping by! üëã

I am a Machine Learning PhD at Georgia Tech working at the intersection of applied and theoretical machine learning. 

Advised by [Dr. Jing Li](https://sites.gatech.edu/jing-li/), our research outcomes have been applied to support the diagnosis, prognosis, and knowledge discovery of various neurological diseases including brain tumor, post-traumatic headache, and Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease. Before that, I worked with [Dr. Sara Shashaani](https://shashaani.wordpress.ncsu.edu/) and [Dr. Julie Swann](https://www.ise.ncsu.edu/people/jlswann/) from NC State University on analyzing millions of medical claims and with [Dr. Yanfang Su](https://globalhealth.washington.edu/faculty/yanfang-su) from UW on analyzing public influence of health organizations on Twitter. 

My research interest fall under three main categories:
 - Machine Learning with limited supervision 
 - Multi-modal learning with incomplete modality data
 - Data mining & knowledge discovery 

Here is my [CV](/assets/pdf/cv_lingchaomao.pdf). Also see [publications](/publications/) and [projects](/projects/) to learn more about my works.
