Hey, thanks for stopping by! üëã

I am a Machine Learning PhD at Georgia Tech working at the intersection of applied and theoretical machine learning, with a focus on machine learning with **integration of domain knowledge** and **multi-modal**, **high-dimensional** datasets. 

Advised by [Dr. Jing Li](https://sites.gatech.edu/jing-li/), our research outcomes have been applied to support the diagnosis, prognosis, and knowledge discovery of various neurological diseases including brain tumor, post-traumatic headache, and Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease. Before that, I worked with [Dr. Sara Shashaani](https://shashaani.wordpress.ncsu.edu/) and [Dr. Julie Swann](https://www.ise.ncsu.edu/people/jlswann/) from NC State University on analyzing millions of medical claims and with [Dr. Yanfang Su](https://globalhealth.washington.edu/faculty/yanfang-su) from UW on analyzing public influence of health organizations on Twitter.
