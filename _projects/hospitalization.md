This project developed machine learning models to predict patient health outcomes (unplanned hospitalizations and hospital readmissions) for Medicare beneficiaries. We predicted eight types of common diseases and four type of adverse events by analyzing over 15M+ Medicare claims and various public datasets. 

We developing a data-driven and knowledge-informed algorithm that divides the population into similar risk groups based on patient demographics, medical history, care quality, and environmental factors we can build more personalized, effective prediction models for each group. We also included a mixed-integer programming-based scoring algorithm to generate monthly hospitalization risk for individual patients.
