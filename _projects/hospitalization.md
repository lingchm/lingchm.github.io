This project developed machine learning models to predict unplanned hospitalization of eight types of common diseases and four type of adverse events by analyzing over 15M Medicare claims and various public datasets. My methodological contributions included co-developing a multi-layered feature selection and dynamic personalized scoring algorithm to predict monthly hospitalization risk for individual patients. 

*This project was led by Drs. Julie Swann and Dr. Sara Shashaani from North Carolina State University. The NCSU team was selected top 25 out of 300+ teams into Stage I of the 2020 national \$1M CMS AI Health Outcomes Challenge.*
