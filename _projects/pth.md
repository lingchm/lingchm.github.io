Post-traumatic headache (PTH) is one of the most common symptoms following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Whereas for some patients headaches resolve quickly, for others, PTH can continue for months or years, causing significant disability and health care burden. The uncertainty about headache recovery adds to patient anxiety and is problematic for clinicians when determining treatment strategies.  

This research investigates biomarker signatures that have utility for predicting the persistence of post-traumatic headache by fusion of multi-modal datasets: 
* Structural imaging: T1-weighted MRI, T2*, DTI
* Functional imaging: fMRI
* Clinical questionnaires
* Speech: mobile-collected speech 

This ongoing project involve interesting modelling chalenges including:
* Early prediction: with the goal to achieve timely treatment and to reduce data collection burden 
* Feature selection: to determine the most predictive biomarkers 
* Incomplete-modality: different patients have different modalities available 
* Heterogeneity: of patient recovery trajectories depending on their prior headaches and commorbidities
